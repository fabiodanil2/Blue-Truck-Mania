Implementation description:

Blue Truck Mania is a game inspired by the famous game Jumper Frog, but it is not based on tiles, but on free movement in the open world. 

In our game the objective is to collect the largest number of coins and hit the largest number of cars with the collectible tomatoes on the map in order to earn points.

The player has three lives, losing one each time it collides with a moving car. When he loses a life, he returns to the starting position (0.0). 

There are other obstacles on the map, namely field animals, in order to match the theme of the player being a tractor. It is not possible to win the game, but to build a highscore. The cars have all autonomous movement, only on the x-axis.
